## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineering graduate from Jimma University** with a strong focus on UI/UX design. I care about clean visuals, smooth user flows, and building things that actually *work* for real people.

I design using **Figma** — fast, precise, and made for modern UI/UX. I’ve worked on multiple mobile and web projects where I handled everything from user flow to high-fidelity design. I don’t over-design, and I always design with development in mind (especially Flutter).

Right now, I’m focused on refining my skills, expanding my portfolio, and creating products that solve real problems.
